    <h1>About ElectionLeaflets.org</h1>
        <p>
            Electioneering is a high-stakes game. We, at ElectionLeaflets.org, believe that itâ€™s time for that game to become a spectator sport.
        </p>
        <p>
            ElectionLeaflets.org is a real-time election leaflet project. Our ambition is to create a live visualization of the flood of party political leaflets as they are delivered across the country during an election campaign.

            If you have recently received any election leaflets through your door you can help by photographing or scanning them and <a href="{% url add_leaflet %}">uploading the images to our server</a>.

            The idea was conjured up in December 2008 at a weekend in Derbyshire, and 
            finally acted upon in Francis's front living room in Cambridge at the end of April 2009.

            The original name of the website was "The Straight Choice", derived from a leaflet in the controversial by-election in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermondsey_by-election,_1983">Bermondsey in 1983</a> which has become the type specimen of accusations of dodgy campaigning. We renamed the site "ElectionLeaflets.org" in August 2010.
